This repository serve me to learn and practice with a React.Js and Reduxe.
As well as React I still need some more practice with a Git Hub,
to learn all the benefits of it. For now I want to experiment with a "branches".
All the tasks I'll work with, will be nested on this repository but on separate branches.

Repository structure:
1. Todo app.
2. Practice with a Router.
